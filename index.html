        <p> My favorite hobby is biking. After I'm done with school and homework, the time is usually 6pm. That's when I like to go for a bike ride. There are a lot fo nice trails to go on, but I like to go around the neighborhood. Going with my family is fun, because we can do races and also stay together. While we're biking, we can visit parks or schools. My little sister also rides with me. It's fun to enjoy the beautiful scenery and also get some fresh air. </p>

            <p> Biking is a fun way to get out in nature! You can look on google maps for biking trails near you. If you are biking to a store or any other place where your bike will be left unattended for some time, try getting a bike lock. When you are on your bike, wear comfortable shoes, like sneakers. Make sure that your wheels, your handles, and your seat is ready to go. If you're riding at night, make sure that you have lights in the back. Always be safe on roads too! Make sure you have your helmet!</p>
